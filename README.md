# Black Hole Observational Data Repository: GRS1915+105 & SWIFTJ1753.5-0127

This repository provides observational datasets of two intriguing black holes in our universe: GRS1915+105 and SWIFTJ1753.5-0127. Long-term observations are crucial for understanding the behavior and the physical properties of these cosmic monsters. 

## Background

**GRS1915+105** is an X-ray binary star system that features a regular star and a black hole. It's known for its variable X-ray and radio emissions and it stands out due to its extraordinary mass, making it an excellent subject for studying stellar evolution and accretion processes.

The work by [Rushton et al. (2010)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...524A..29R/abstract) titled "Steady jets from radiatively efficient hard states in GRS 1915+105" presents evidence of a close relationship between the radio and X-ray emission at different epochs for GRS 1915+105. The study found that both the radio and X-ray emissions decay from the start of most plateau states, with the radio emission decaying faster. These findings point towards two possible interpretations: a radiatively efficient accretion disk during the continuous outflow of a compact jet or X-ray emission in the plateau state dominated by emission from the base of the jet.

**SWIFTJ1753.5-0127**, on the other hand, is a transient X-ray source discovered in 2005. Long-term monitoring has revealed a complex pattern of X-ray and radio behavior, offering valuable insights into the jet formation and energy transfer processes in black holes.
